/**
 * The listener interface for receiving "interesting" swipe events (connect,
 * disconnect, start, stop, read data, and parse data) on a reader.
 *
 * The class that is interested in processing a swipe event either implements
 * this interface (and all the methods it contains).
 *
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * SwipeHandler using the SwipeHandler's addSwipeListener method. A swipe event
 * is generated when the reader is connected, disconnected, started work or
 * stopped work. A swipe event is also generated when read data from the reader
 * or parse the read data.
